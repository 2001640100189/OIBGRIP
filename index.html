<h2>A brief summary of Unnikrishnan's journey</h2>

<h3>Operation Black Tornado</h3>
<p>
    On the night of 26 November 2008, several buildings in South Mumbai were attacked.
    One of the buildings where hostages were held was the iconic 100-year-old Taj Mahal Palace Hotel.
    Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan was the team commander of 51 Special Action Group (51 SAG) deployed in the hotel to rescue the hostages.
</p>
<p>
    Unnikrishnan and his team continued evacuating hostages from the hotel, for around 15 hours.
    On 27 November, around midnight Unnikrishnan and his team decided to take the path of the central staircase of hotel to go up,
    as it was their only path towards the hostages and terrorists.
</p>
<p>
    He arranged for his evacuation and continued to engage terrorists in the firefight.
    He then decided to chase terrorists alone, as they were trying to escape to the next floor.
    In the encounter that followed, he managed to corner all four terrorists to the Ballroom in the northern end of Taj Mahal hotel,
    single-handedly but sacrificed his life in the course.
</p>
<p>
    His last words were, <strong>"Don't come up, I will handle them"</strong>according to the NSG officials.
    NSG commandos later killed all four terrorists trapped in the Ballroom and Wasabi restaurant of the Mumbai Taj hotel.
</p>
<p>
    Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan led the commando operation launched on 27th November 2008
    to flush out terrorists from Hotel Taj Mahal, Mumbai in which he rescued 14 hostages.
</p>
<p>
    During the operation, his team came under intense hostile fire, in which one of his team members got grievously injured. 
    Sandeep pinned down the terrorists with accurate fire and rescued the injured commando to safety.
    In the process, he was shot in his right arm. Despite his injuries, he continued to fight the terrorists till his last breath.
</p>
<p>
    Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan displayed most conspicuous bravery besides camaraderie
    and leadership of the highest order and made the supreme sacrifice for the nation.
</p>
<p>
    He dies at the age of 31.</p>
